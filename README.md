# Releaf-Pro
Assessment Project for summer internship at Releaf

The feed.py scraps all rss feeds on allafrica.com for company names in SAMPLE_DATA.csv and creates a new .csv file (Final.csv) containing the urls of the articles where company's name was found.

The feed.py uses:
FeedParser
BeautifulSoup
Pandas

The current Final.csv file is output of feed.py where on finding the keyword 'Africa' the URL of that article and the company name from SAMPLE_DATA.csv was added as finding the actual company names was taking quite long.

Proper comments in feed.py have been provided wherever felt necesssary.

Screenshots folder contains some pictures of script running.
